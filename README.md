# ðŸ’¾ Download Emoji Backend

This repository holds both the Terraform infrastructure code as well as the simple Javascript application that runs inside the AWS Lambda function.

This application code is a basic image converter service that takes in a URL to a [Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) SVG image and will convert it out to either a `.jpeg` or `.png` image at an arbitrary size. This application leverages the [`sharp`](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) library for quick, high-quality conversions.

The infrastructure supporting this backend application is a simple public API Gateway that forwards valid requests to the Lambda function.

This backend application is used to support the website [https://downloademoji.dev](https://downloademoji.dev) for quick and reliable downloads of high-quality emoji.
